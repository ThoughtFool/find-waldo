## The Challenge

Create a unique re-interpretation on the classic game of "Where's Waldo". A game that displays two offset images in focus, while giving the illusion that Waldo's glasses are making clear a third, blurred-out image.

### CHALLENGE ACCEPTED!

### CHALLENGE ACCEPTED...AGAIN!
Create an admin screen, that allows admins the mark where Waldo is hidden, on various screens. Admins can drag a selection window to record Waldo's position, updating game object.
